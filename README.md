# nicar-2016
I've compiled all the notes I took at NICAR 2016. My favorite sessions were [FOIA tricks](https://github.com/wcraft/nicar-2016/blob/master/foia_tricks.md), [The Risks and Rewards of Rolling Your Own Criminal Justice Data](https://github.com/wcraft/nicar-2016/blob/master/criminal_justice_data.md), and any session where they talked about the Tampa Bay Times story, [Failure Factories](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2015/investigations/pinellas-failure-factories/)

Here is a [massive list of nearly all the slides and tipsheets from the conference](j.mp/nicar16). It is still being updated.
