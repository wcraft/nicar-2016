I've compiled all the notes I took at NICAR 2016. My favorite sessions were [FOIA tricks](https://github.com/wcraft/nicar-2016/blob/master/foia_tricks.md) and [The Risks and Rewards of Rolling Your Own Criminal Justice Data](https://github.com/wcraft/nicar-2016/blob/master/criminal_justice_data.md)
