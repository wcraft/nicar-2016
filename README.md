# nicar-2016
I've compiled all the notes I took at NICAR 2016. My favorite sessions were [FOIA tricks](https://github.com/wcraft/nicar-2016/blob/master/foia_tricks.md) and [The Risks and Rewards of Rolling Your Own Criminal Justice Data](https://github.com/wcraft/nicar-2016/blob/master/criminal_justice_data.md)

Here is a [massive list of nearly all the slides and tipsheets from the conference](j.mp/nicar16). It is still being updated.
