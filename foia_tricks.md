FOIA Tricks
==========
Jason Leopold, FOIA Wizard for Vice
* covers nat sec for Vice, aggressively uses FOIA to get docs from state and federal govt on topics where it is tough to get people to go on the record
* responsible for Clinton's email, the DOJ white paper to kill Anwar Al-Alaki
* files FOIA requests several times a week
* has 2 dozen foia lawsuits currently ongoing

## Know where the govt has the data
* crucial for reporters to build a template that describes exactly where you want these agencies to search for the info
  * by law, the govt needs to process as long as you reasonably describe the records
* the reason requests take a long time, reporters do not reasonably describe the docs nor inform where they should be searching
  * every agency has a "system of record"
  * that breaks down, within the agency, where information is stored, where they hold certain databases
    * The govt needs to figure out where your information is, so if YOU help them by telling them where the data you want is stored, you can speed it up by 3-4 months
* instruct them where to search and how to search, gets you much more responsive records
* put the time and effort into reporting where the records may be located
* example: CIA
  * lots of different offices
  * if you are looking for records dealing with counter-terrorism record, direct your request to a specific division dealing with counter-terrorism
    * the FOIA analyst has to take it, they need to figure it out, if you help them, you get faster responses. They WANT to fulfill requests

## FBI
* the worst with responding to FOIA
  * they will say they searched their central records  
* always state that you want them to search ELSR and cross-reference search
* cross-reference files are a different file system than the FBI central records

## Appeals
* very important to appeal every response you get, even if the agency turns over everything. There may even be more documents than what they handed over even if they say they gave you everything
* On appeal, Jason got 900 more pages than they first gave him
  * on every appeal, they find and give more information
* you don't need to put an argument in your appeal, simply say "I appeal the integrity of the search"
* Appeal any and all redactions, all you need to say is that the redactions are unnecessary, they may be willing to disclose more information than they have at first

## Meta-FOIA
* file a FOIA for the processing notes to see how the agency is handling the FOIA request
* a good way to understand how the FOIA process works
* There is a paper trail from the moment a request lands of the desk of a FOIA analyst
  * will see the names of databases that are undisclosed, becomes information that you can then use
* really important for people covering national security, because govt agencies are super reluctant to give out information relating to nat. sec.
  * will be able to see the discussion related to the records, understand the debate that they are having over the records

## Denied
* What do we do now, we've been denied and have no money for lawsuits
* There is an office! Office of Govt Information Services
  * there is an effort by the DoJ to weaken this office
* they provide mediation services to people who want information, act as a go-between
* they can get documents for you that the other govt agencies are not willing to give out the info
  * reach out with your denials

## States
* The states are very different, each state has their own public records laws

## Expedited Processing
* burden on the requester to prove that expedited processing is needed
  * DoJ easiest to prove to, hilariously enough, even though, "the DoJ sucks" -JL
* what is the pressing need, how would the public be harmed if the info isn't out immediately

## Pipeline
* try to build a pipeline for getting FOIA requests out
  * if you see a news story that mentions a document, memo, or report, file a FOIA to request that information
  * eventually the govt will get to all the requests, you will start to get information every week
  * even if the data is old, or the story is past, you can still do something with that information
* there are issues that are always relevant, so getting a steady stream of information, the data may be old, but the story is still relevant
* most agencies keep FOIA logs (except for the FBI)
  * you can see what other people are asking for
  * majority of FOIA requests come from corporations and private individuals
* Reading other requests is also very helpful for improving your own FOIA template
  * the goal is cutting down the time between submitting and getting the data, can get it down to 3-6 months, which is very fast...

## FOIA Online
* you can search the requests, limited to a certain number of govt agencies
  * you don't need to file for someone's requests
* you can also get the data that has been released to other people

## lawsuits
* an agency has denied your request, you really want the data, what do you do
  * You have to sue
* It's a myth that it will cost a lot of money to file suits against the government
  * if you are looking for a highly classified govt documents, it will be a long fight
  * lower security files that you want, if you file a lawsuit you work with the govt attorney and work out a production schedule
    * after filing a lawsuit you cut the time down significantly  
* costs usually stay in the 4-digit range, never get into the six-figure range

## Questions
* Q: What do you do when you file a request, and they charge a ton of money?
  * A: go for the fee waiver, need to put in fee waiver language, describe what you are going to use the documents for, identify who you are and who you work for, and that you should be entitled to the fee waiver
    * make it as difficult as possible for the agency to deny you. Appeal if they say no, they are dragging their feet.
* Q: What happens if the govt starts hating you for filing so many? Also if you know you are requesting something dangerous that they dont want to release, how do you change tactics to get around this?
  * A: broaden the request, ask for information that includes what you want. Language is very very important in your FOIA request, "Any and all... relating and refering to..." not just "about", the language you use is used by the agency to drag their feet or deny you.
* Q: What if they are taking a long time?
  * A: they are required to tell you how long it might take, you can send emails that put the agency on notice that you know what the agency is required to do. Put language in the request that stipulates the time.
    * IF they aren't getting back to you, work through OGIS
    * read through the amendments and laws relating
* Q: tell us about Hilary's emails
  * A: JL a fierce proponent of transparency, wanted access to the emails because he thought that the records would provide insight into how she would be as president. She wasn't exempt from FOIA when she was Secretary of State
  * sued in Jan. 2015, then in March 2015, NYT broke that she was using a private email server
  * Judge ordered that the emails must be released in a rolling release
* Q: How do you keep track?
  * A: log everything in a spreadsheet
* Q: what is the success rate?
  * A: very successful, once records declassifed through FOIA, you can get people on record that previously wouldn't
    * Also he has "a really good attorney"
  * Requires a huge investment of time
  * Develop a good relationship with FOIA analysts, nothing is helped yelling at them and being mean
* Q: Process takes so long, how do you deal with things like job change?? In the middle of the process
  * A: he files as a journalist working with Vice News, not AS Vice news. That means he can take the information with him when he leaves. Allows the documents to travel. He also uses his personal email. The agencies WILL close your requests if you leave jobs. Language: "I am requesting as a journalist who will publish with Vice"
* Q: appeal when they have already given information, do you need to prove that you have a reason?
  * A: No, you only need to say you appeal the integrity. If you think they didn't search certain places, then you should say that. ALWAYS appeal the FBI, they are not searching where they should be
* Q: Do you FOIA for everything? Or do you ever just call and ask without officially filing
  * A: You can ask, when they say no, you FOIA. Asking first for unclassified things is much easier
