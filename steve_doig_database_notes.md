==
Steve Doig, Professor, Cronkite School of Journalism

* not necessarily business databases
* there are a ton of databases out there.
  * survey of state agencies, asking "what databases do you keep"
* so we will be doing more than just business data
  * there is treasure everywhere! there is interesting information to be found if you go out and try and get at it

## Census.gov
* we think of the census as the 10 year survey, but they do a lot more, involved in measuring a lot of activity, both economic and business
* decenial and american business survey
* ACS - american community survey
  * replaces 'the longform'
  * ACS a rolling survey, each month they are gathering new information

    * occupation
    * industry
    * class of worker
    * income
    * health insurance coverage
    * commuting
    * place of work
  * there are more though!

  * how accurate is the census, since it is self-reported
    * people do lie, but usually not about mundane things
    * some q's likely to have a higher degree of inaccuracy
    * census does outreach to try and tell people that
    * not 100% accurate but the best we got
    * there is also an error margin around many answers
      * round census numbers off, don't imply that the census is spot-on

## Business.census.gov
* measuring the economic life of what is happening in the us
* there are forms biz's required to fill out
* 2012 economic census reports still coming out
* have to go through american factfinder
  * factfinder.census.gov
  * the lookup engine for all kinds of data
  * there is a complicated way of zeroing in on what we want
* q: is this more accurate, since there is laws for biz's filling them out
  * biz's have to file with the IRS too so should be easy to spot mismatches
  * same situation as the ACS, we have to acknowledge the limits of the databases
  * this is official stuff though, used by US govt to do things like plan interest rate hikes and other things
* categories

## US trade online

    * this can be used for reporting for international things

## Bureau of Economic Analysis

* brought in experts and census workers to produce a series of 17 videos with slides on how to deal with each of the different census sites/datasets

## Federal Reserve
* keeps a lot of the data they use to make decisions about the economy, do their own data gathering on economic data

  * brought in through different agencies
  * they have lists about what they are doing

## Securities and Exchange Commission

* edgar
  * access to the forms that companies are required to fill out

  * focus on the SEC and some federal court data
  * they have a decent interface for finding material, set up alerts for different companies
  * if you can find the words that you are interested in you can find the relevant filings

## Federal Courts
* bankruptcy decided in federal courts
  * pacer.gov, you can do searches of federal court databases
  * need an account, and there is a charge for viewing/downloading the filings
  * if your total for 3 months is less than $10, they won't bill you
    * it is more open than people realize, more than 30 pages, they charge you $3 and leave it alone
* Q: is there a way to search all courts for the same company?
  * A: yes, you should be able to, you should be able to search by the name of a company and see all filings in all courts

## Bureau of Labor Statistics
* deals with labor and workforce stats, also deals with the consumer price index

  * long list of things they cover in the slides

## Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services

  * lists of medical providers and the services they provide
  * lists of medical clinics
    * Steve matched a bunch of medical clinics to PO box addresses, showing that they were defrauding the services


# State and Local data
## OSHPD
* California office of public health
  * require hospitals to file information on patients discharged from hospital or emergency room, 10s of millions of records
  * should be available in different states
  * age range, date admitted, diagnoses, codes for treatments given, whole list of charges for the services the hospitals did
    * those charges are basically a fantasy, does not accurately reflect what is paid because medicare/insurance have bartered
      * can compare different hospitals, the different charges for the services they are provided
* Steve used this information to look into 'upcoding' on certain conditions
  * someone would come in for high blood pressure, given a different code that medicare would pay more money for
* took the data, looked at rates of different diagnoses, compared hospital chains, looked for hospital outliers
* lots of different stories can come from this kind of information
  * look at rates of procedures at different hospitals
    * also the names of the doctors/surgeons that are performing the procedures
* The data can be used to see emergency room admissions for heroin overdoses
  * you might be charged, depending on the state?
  * talk to your state health department about what data is available
* Q: how quickly updated?
  * A: at least for arizona, about 6 months behind
* There are over 100 variables, you can get a lot of information out of the data
  * slides have more information on which variables
  * interesting variable: who pays for it

## BEBR
* bureau of economic and business research, in florida
  * basically the business survey but for the state, probably available in your state
  * state universities might have that information, might be gathering, independent economists can also help verify

## Corporate Commissions
* look into the state agency tracking corporations in your state, the database should be something you can use public records laws to go after

## Property Appraisers
* property tax roll, look into how much tax dollars based on property valuation
  * Steve looked into whether the agency itself is properly assessing the values of the high end homes, found high-end homes were being sold for way more than the property was assessed for
    * his house was assessed much higher than any house around after he published articles on this
    * got his revenge by publishing a bunch of data that allowed people to challenge the assessment they were given
* Steve used the tax roll to do a study on lead paint
  * used the age range of the houses to show which neighborhoods had a high concentration of homes that were in the ages of homes that had lead paint
  * also used property tax roll to look at a connection between the age of a home and destruction during a storm

## Professional Licenses
* there are a ton of licensing agencies, lots and lots of agencies tracking these
* gotta go looking for what is licensed in which states, maybe a board of professional licenses?
  * handing out licenses and revoking licenses are people within that industry, not an independent watch-group

NOTE
Fight for the data, know the relevant laws about what people can and can't charge for the data that you are looking for, keep after it

## Judicial Branch
* state courts, look into local and state courts for documents
* state supreme courts, county courts, may have good look-up systems
  * more than just criminal cases, civil courts too, who is being sued, who is suing

# International Data
* the US has a lot of access to data, great reporters in other countries have a harder time getting access to the data
* in reality, the US has it vastly better than other countries
  * we, as an industry, used to sue companies/govt and take them to court over open-data
  * in other countries, not a great number of ways to compel agencies to release
  * int. data is being freed up

## World bank
* money! development money, big loans, development indexes

## National Statistics Sites
* look at the national statistic site for the country, maybe not as many split up agencies that the US has, but probably has similar level of data
* often a lot of the site has readily downloadable data just like the US census site
* can we trust it? good question. Some countries more so, other countries, very willing to flat-out lie about information

## OECD
* a good source of economic development data, infrastructure development data

## Gapminder
* a site that allows for visualization of a lot of different information/variables

## IRE/NICAR Data archives
* IRE members has a bunch of data archives available for purchase
  * a great trove of data gathered from federal agencies
  * will help extract data that you want, like if you only want your state's data
* have both economic and other data
  * Home Owner disclosure act data, SBA 7a Business Loans data, DOT fatality analysis reporting system, etc etc


## Databases from the Audience
* data.gov - an attempt to look transparent, not that good, very sparse
* learning what is in these datasets is really important for developing stories out of the data, HMDA data specifically for one audience member was very valuable for working out stories of different kinds. Loan size was the basis of one story, race of the borrower developed into another story
* consumer financial protection bureau has a lot of variables and can be searched by state, city, company, complaint
  * different agencies have different complaint
* MSRB has a database called EMMA, has disclosures that you can look up
* franchise disclosure agreements
* FDIC.gov
