## Procurement database
* how the local govt spends money
* specific ways that you have to request the data
  * the wording you use is in the presentation notes hopefully
  * want to ask for the individual things that they have purchased
* if they are saying that they can't export the data, they are lying
* smartprocure
* vague language on the procurement form, probably something else
  * you can get the purchase order, then request all documents related to the purchase order number, the shipping documents
    * used the procurement database to show that
