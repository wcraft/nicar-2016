## NarcoData
Tania Montalvo, Animal Politico
* They wanted to analyze four years of organized crime in Mexico
  * set out to collect as much data as they could from both govt and academia
  * constructed their own databases, because no electronic data existed before they started
    * Shows how, in 40 years, trafficking expanded
* 1970's, two big criminal organization, now there are nine, all broke off from the original two
  * wanted people to understand what the real size of organized crime is

## Jobs Promise Explorer
Tyler Dukes, WRAL
* North Carolina, lots of money flowing into companies promising to hire and bring in jobs
  * are the companies meeting their promises
  * built a database to track hiring and average wages at certain companies
  * wanted to hold the politicians to their promises when they made statements about how many jobs they would bring
* Gauges how many jobs created versus promised
* they did a lot of calculations to compliment the data they got from the dept of commerce
* Found that 40% of the companies failed to hire a single worker
* the data analysis wasn't difficult, but it was on a subject that few people ever saw or understood

## La Nacion Tipsheet
Ricardo Brom, La Nacion
* the tipsheet runs through how LN did a massive amount of data analysis and OCR on text documents they aquired from the Argentine govt
* made a database for all the reporters in the newsroom to use.
* converted PDF to text
  * the text was filthy, tried 8 different OCR, found that converting pdf to txt was the most successful

## Interrogating the data
* What do we mean when we say we are interrogating the data, what is a typical way of starting
* The first thing we think to do
  * depends on the data, is it a spreadsheet from the Dept of Commerce?
  * try and get a sense of what the data is telling you, find outliers, narrow the focus
    * outliers, averages, what is normal and what isn't, really know what the data means, how it was gathered
* data is always talking, the data always has more than what you realized
  * you start with a question, "how many criminal orgs in Mx?"
    * the data you gather answers your first question, but raises many more and leads to more stories than you first thought
    * used the data to bust myths
* Use data to check the promises that people have made, does the data support what people have said about the data
  * In Argentina, they gather both structured and unstructured data, and try and put it in a format usable by other journalists
* Know what you want the data to answer will help you comb through it, helps you narrow in on what you are searching for in the data
* Your analysis can be unsophisticated, at WRAL they did all their analysis using excel and basic percentage math
  * you don't need super math to check whether or not the data shows that politicians are lying
  * tools can help you do traditional reporting
    * overview, document cloud etc, helps you get through a massive amount of material
* Don't be afraid to ask small questions, the best way to start digging in might be asking a small, simple question like , "who did this the most/least?"
  * simple questions are the scaffolding of larger more difficult questions
* keep track of where your data came from, especially if rolling your own data from multiple sources, allows you to cross reference all your information
* Look at the laws that led to data being generated, will help you understand the context
