Tips
History of Data journalism
Which sessions should we go to

## What is data journalism
It's a tool that we have to further our reporting. We don't need to be on a huge team of data journalism to use CAR

Database library: lots of data crunching, help other journalists work through

We are here to help eachother! People love helping eachother

CAR - computer assisted reporting, coined in 1989 at Missouri

## The Process
* start with a hypothesis, can be a simple question, has the testing been done?
* Then, what do we need to know to answer, what data is available
  * getting the data, does it exist in a govt database
  * if you scrape the data, call the govt agency make sure you know what the data is saying!
* CHECK CHECK CHECK CHECK
  * duplicates, different names, different orgs calling things differently
* Interview
  * write up a set of questions that you would ask the data as if it is a person
  * then break down what the analysis will be
* EDIT the data
  * talk through the data with other people, have people double check the data
  * talk through the process, go through the
* double check!!!
  * show the data, show the visualization to others, do they understand

## Classic Stories
The slides have good stories
* Measurement
  * LA Times, how much money do schools get from powerball
* Comparison
* Watchdog
  * the NPR/Redcross
* Change over time
* Context
* Regulation
  * Regulators have DATA
  * are they regulating, are they doing enough inspections, are there enough inspectors
  * infrastructure stories are super important, we have such poor infrastructure
* ANYWHERE THERE IS A FORM THERE IS A DATABASE
  * try and get a form name, you can get the database of the form entries
  * YOU CAN REQUEST IT!!! Request the form and the information in the forms


## Public information
* Public information acts request
* keep track of your requests and the people you have spoken to

## BEST PRACTICES
* keep a copy of the original, don't work off of it
* log everything you do
  * write down the formulas, write down the joins, make comments, keep track of everything
* interrogate data
  * look for common sense metrics, ask basic commonsense questions, get good editting
  * you can even ask the agencies, see what they have to say
* keep track of your methodology, write out all caveats, the more info you give to the public the better your reporting
* use visualizations as appropriate

## The Conference
* it is getting really big, its been going on since 1993
  * the first conference only had 300, data journalism is not a new thing
* How should we approach the conference?
  * ask questions, everyone has been a beginner, we are all here to learn
* Pick something
  * choose a project that you can use when you go home, think of a story that we might have, don't try to learn something in a vacuum
* Don't get overwhelmed, don't be afraid about not going to every session
* Meet new people, people are cool and nice, also good to learn how other newsrooms do things
  * how do you do data for breaking news? how did you choose what to learn
* Get skills
  * learn the lingo, don't worry just ask people what that means. CS naming makes NO SENSE, python, django, d3, R, flask??
  * cleaning data, we are all going to have to do it
    * excel magic, open refine, regular expressions
  * analyze data
    * excel, SQL, stats, command line tools, python, R
  * visualize data
    * fusion tables, tableau, cartodb, d3, javascript, etc
  * map the data
    * arcgis, cartodb, QGIS, fusion tables
      * arcgis might give out a free license
* Planting the seeds, you wont come away an expert, you have to keep working at the ideas you pick up, learn what you can do
* note visualizations can really help with the analysis portion of your reporting, can help you see things that you might not have been able to see

## Ideas
* Finding the story: Campaign Finance, Health, Energy, Crime, infrastructure
  * hands on classes where we grapple the data
* there is an election track all about the different election sessions
* Digital Security track
  * we should all care about digital security
* Brownbag lawyer lunch, all about FOIA
* career roundtable, get career advice on getting jobs and interviewing
* Panels on lots of information like Dark Money
* NICAR Conversations track, smaller groups talking about interesting topics
* Only learn programming language when you absolutely need to. SQL and excel will do for most of the journalists out there
