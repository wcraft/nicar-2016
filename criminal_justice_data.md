Risks and Rewards of Rolling Your Own Criminal Justice Data
===========
Building your own criminal justice databases, the approach and the danger of building your own data

"The data is an unmitigated disaster" - Deputy Managing Editor, Marshall Project

presentation notes: bit.ly/cjcar16

## Behind the bloodshed
Jodi Upton
* No one was gathering data on mass shootings
* No data from gun advocacy groups, all shootings, things that happen in a family
  * all the data is important to collect
* Lots of states don't report to the FBI
  * collecting data from google alerts, found a lot of data not in the FBI
  * lots of incidents in the FBI data didn't actually exist!
  * accuracy around 50%, with the mass shooting data
* So many hybrid cases
  * needed to define what is and isn't a mass killing, did it happen in public or private

## The Counted
Kenan Davis, The Guardian
* started with reporting from Ferguson
  * out of the reporting came conversations on policing, there is no official record of number of people killed in the US
* The Guardian attempted to do that count
* note: collaborated with the audience engagement folks from the very beginning, wanted the audience to be involved with the project
  * crowdsourcing very important to the project
* will continue the process of keeping track, holding the govt accountable

## Police Shootings at the Washington Post
Steven Rich, WaPo
* q: what is the context for Ferguson? How often do the police shoot people
* wanted to make the data available, even if it meant that people published stories that WaPo didn't
* so many stories coming out of the database
  * made no attempt to say whether the shootings were justified or not, tried to stay away from that
  * KEEP OPINION OUT, KEEP OWN JUDGMENT OUT

## The Next to Die
Gabriel Dance, Marshall Project
* tracks who is the next person to be executed
* lots of good info from the death penalty information center
  * lots of records looking back, upcoming schedule
* states keep track of executions, not the federal level
  * plus there are states where it is legal but they don't execute people
    * or Pennsylvania, which condemns people but gives them stays


## How did it start
* projects arose from simple questions, how did everyone make sure that the data didn't already exist
* police shootings, lots of coverage on the lack of data, all the experts were saying they were dying for the data
* open source projects were working on some of the data that the teams were gathering
* mass shooting, refused to use advocacy data, and all the experts gave completely different answers
* MP: wanted to bring accountability in the minutes before an execution, wanted something that had more accuracy and power than what existed. It's too late to pay attention if the person already executed
  * uses claxon to check for updates on the death penalty information center, and it wasn't updated fast enough

## What sort of resources does it take
* Once the pipeline is set up, it doesn't take a ton of resources, build things to scale and to last
  * usually one person tasked for the daily work, getting info on a particular incident
* WaPo very different, had almost 75 people work on it at some point, day to day work though only on 2 people, researchers at WaPo
  * sometimes has to do artisinal geocoding, looking through pictures and street view to get the information
  * time consuming for the researchers
* Marshall Project very small, The Next to Die was only 2 people
  * partnered with 7 orgs to spread the information and complicated processing of appeals
  * lots of people getting to work on it
  * nights of executions, they have 2 people staying up all night monitoring the execution
  * there is very little automation on the gathering, all through reporting and people with sources
    * all of the social media is automated
  * identified states and reached out to IRE members in those states, those reporters work with and source the information
* USA Today's project, the longest running of any of them
  * 7 initial people, a few doing the research and calling, plus designers
  * now have a pipeline down, so it is much faster
  * needs a couple people to monitor everything because it takes up so much of what they are thinking about

## Methodology and Determining the Universe
* helps to start a major project with naivety, because then you don't realize how hard it is
  * methodology, have to decide what the minimum is for including an incident in the database, allows a narrowing down of the world into a manageable way
    * This is still very hard, because there are so many difficult edge cases
* you can never prepare enough, because there will be things that challenge your classifications
  * WaPo needed to deal with trans individuals, do you identify them as they did themselves, or how the govt identified them on the records
* MP, narrowing the universe allowed them to do the project
  * only decided to cover states that had executed people since 2013 and continue to schedule executions
    * left them with 9 states
    * the DAY they published a new state scheduled 9 executions, so they decided to add it, but then later lawsuits over the execution drugs stopped them
* How to classify police death? tasers? in custody? Only when shot?

## What to do when another group is doing something similar, or using a different methodology
* The more scrutiny on a subject, the better
* these are things that need to be covered, so having multiple orgs is really good
* WaPo and the Guardian have different methodologies, so they aren't putting out the same data
  * WaPo only wanted to cover when a cop's bullet killed someone, so they do cover a different field than the Guardian
  * they found other things that needed to be covered, like cops killing their families, but wanted to keep the focus on state violence

## Evaluating Historic data
* MP wanted to know how many people have been put to death
* historic data only has dates, not times
  * but there were lots of times where there were people being executed at the same time as other people, wanted to put them in order so they could say that the next to die is the Nth person killed
* exchanged information with the Death Penalty Information Center
  * then went to academics and exchanged more information and updated

## Questions
* Q: Rolling our own data, how do you vet the data, who do you run the data by?
  * A: You get things wrong sometimes, USA Today found multiple events that they missed by changing their research methods, constantly look at things that are changing and how you have been gathering
    * WaPo refuses to say that they have a definitive number, make sure your reader knows the caveats in your data
    * MP: executions very easy to verify, with some work. They built a system for partners to add information and data input but they need to personally approve and put in the info that a person has been executed, need to ensure that they are right before they publish
* Q: how do you feel about others using the data?
    * A: WaPo: if we didn't want others to use the data, we wouldn't have published the data, we want others to be able to analyze the data as well.
      * Marshall Project got people to come on to the project because of the need to cover the most serious punishment the state hands down
      * They will be able to give back the data to others to analyze trends after it ends in 2016
      * Everyone on the panel is here because the govt is doing a shitty job collecting the data, this is information that is for the public good, so it needs to be out there to help the public
* Q: For shootings, how do you use crowdsourcing to do your reporting
  * A: Never let a user entered information go live, it always needs to be corrected, fact-checked, verified, and reported
    * Use crowdsourcing to help gather information, not report the information, tips often wrong
* Q: what other sorts of things don't fit into your projects that deserve reporting?
  * A: cops killing families very important, one of the big other findings in the police shooting data, the teams talk about them, put them off for later.
    * USA today looked for women suspects
* Q: How to deal with unverifiable data, how do you weigh what it could add, versus what you can't verify
  * A: if you can't verify, don't publish. State sponsored violence, we probably will never really know. You have to throw out a lot of good data
* Q: Any govt agencies using the journalists datasets?
  * A: the fed govt starting a pilot program based on the methodology that the newspapers have started using to track shootings
  * Academics love the datasets, they use the data to do analyses that they couldn't ever do before 
  * govt used to allow the data to be voluntarily reported
